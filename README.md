# Automatic File Sorter using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Python automation script designed to organize files in a directory
(File Explorer) by automatically sorting them into folders based on file types.

The script checks whether folders for each file type already exist. If not, it creates
the required folders and moves files such as `.txt`, `.csv`, `.png`, etc., into their
respective directories.

## 🛠 Tools & Concepts Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- File Handling (`os`, `shutil`)
- Automation Scripts

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Scans all files in the target directory
2. Identifies file types based on extensions
3. Creates folders for each file type (if not already present)
4. Moves files into their respective folders

## 🎯 Real-Life Use Case
- Organizing cluttered download folders
- Automating repetitive file management tasks
- Understanding practical Python automation

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- Improved understanding of Python file system operations
- Hands-on experience with automation scripts
- Practical problem-solving using Python
